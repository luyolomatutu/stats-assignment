```{r, quick look, include=TRUE}
data("anscombe")
dim(anscombe)
names(anscombe)
head(anscombe, n=6)
tail(anscombe, n=6)
summary(anscombe)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r xy_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', fig.path='./figures/', fig.ext='svg'}
data("anscombe")
plot(x=anscombe$x1, y=anscombe$y1)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
