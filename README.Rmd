## Hello Octocat
i love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

```{r, quick look, include=TRUE}
data("anscombe")
dim(anscombe)
names(anscombe)
head(anscombe, n=6)
tail(anscombe, n=6)
summary(anscombe)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r xy_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', fig.path='./figures/', fig.ext='svg'}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
data("anscombe")
plot(x=anscombe$x1, y=anscombe$y1)
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}
path <- file.path('~', 'stats assignment', 'analgesic.csv')
df <- data.frame('analgesic.csv')
df <- read.csv('analgesic.csv')
```

```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
dim(df)
names(df)
head(df, n=6)
tail(df, n=6)
summary(df)
```

```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
df_1 <- gather(df, key= Measurements, value= Value, Measurement_1, Measurement_2, Measurement_3, -ID)
df_2 <- group_by(df_1, ID, Group)
summarise(df_2, mean = mean(Value))

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Chicken Weights
## null hypothesis
* chick weights are not dependent on the feed

## alternative hypothesis
* chick weights are dependent on the feed
```{r echo=TRUE}
# read chick weight
x <- read.csv('chick-weights.csv')

# tidy the data
boxplot(x$weight ~ x$feed)

# statistical test
chickanova <- aov(weight~feed, data = x)
summary(chickanova)
```
## underlying assumption for test:
* trying to determine whether there are significant differences between the means of 3 or more unrelated groups

## interpretation of the outcome
* p<0.05, therefore reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis

# The Hot Zone 
## null hypothesis
* H0: drinking contaminated water does not causes gastroenteritis

## alternative hypothesis
* H1: drinking contaminated water does cause gastroenteritis
```{r echo=TRUE}
# read outbreak of gastroenteritis
x <- read.csv('file:///E:/stats assignment/gastroenteritis (1).csv')

#tidy the data
y <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome, data = x)
y

#plotting data
barplot(y, beside = TRUE, ylab = 'water consumption', xlab = "clinical presentation", main= 'investigation of gastroenteritis outbreak', col = c("red", "orange", "green"))
legend('top', c("<1 glasses/day", ">4 glasses/day", "1 to 4 glasses/day"), fill = c("red", "orange", "green"))

# statistical test
z <- chisq.test(y, correct = TRUE)
z
```
## assumptions that underly the test
* two categorical variables from a single population
* used to determine whether there is an association between two variables

## interpretation of outcomes
* p< 0.05, therefore reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis

# Nausea
## null hypothesis
* emetogenic chemotherapy for breast cancer does not cause nausea

## alternative hypothesis
* emetogenic chemotherapy for breast cancer causes nausea
```{r echo= TRUE}
# read nausea
x <- read.csv('nausea.csv')

# tidy the data
# changed the 40 from row 8, column 3 to 4, because I think that might be a typo, seeing that the scale goes from 0-6
x[8,3] = 4
x

# plotting data
plot(x$Nausea_before~x$Patient, type = "l", ylim = c(0,6), xlab = "patient", ylab = "nausea score", col = "purple", main = 'rating of nausea before and after receiving chemotherapy')
lines(x$Nausea_after, col = "pink")
legend("center", c("Nausea_before", "Nausea_after"), fill = c("purple", "pink"))

#statistical test
wilcox.test(x$Nausea_before,x$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)
```
## assumption that underlies the test
* the data is non-parametric
* two measurements taken from the same individual

## interpretation of the outcome
* p< 0.05, therefore reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypothesis
